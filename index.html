            <h4> Number of ways you can climb the stairs</h4>

            <p>Consider a staircase, you can take n steps to reach the top. You can climb one or 2 steps each time. How many distinct ways you can climb to the top?</p>
            <p>This is the kind of exercise that is not straightforward to write a solution. Consider some stairs that you can take 4 steps to reach the top.<br>
            These are your options to climb it:<br>
            1 step, 1 step, 1 step, 1 step<br>
            1 step, 1 step, 2 steps <br>
            1 step, 2 steps, 1 step,<br>
            2 steps, 1 step, 1 step,<br>
            2 steps, 2 steps<br>
            -----------------<br>
            5 ways to climb it.
            </p>
            <p>Kinda weird to think on a solution for this. Specially when the number go high and you have so many ways to climb it, right? Well, people can use one technique called memoization to solve it. <br>
            <a>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization</a><br>The main idea is that you are going to hold the results that you are getting in order to not 
            have to calculate them again.<br> I am going to use the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> language to describe to you how we can solve this problem.</p>
            
            <pre>
struct Solution;

impl Solution {
    pub fn climb_stairs(n: i32) -> i32 {
        // this struct is going to help us to hold the results 
        // for the i'th step.
        let mut memo: Vec<i32> = vec![0; n as usize + 1];

        Self::check_stairs(0, n, &mut memo)
    }

    fn check_stairs(i: i32, n: i32, memo: &mut Vec<i32>) -> i32 {
        // This will happen when the ith step is beyond
        // the size of the stairs
        if i > n {
            return 0;
        }

        // If the i'th step is equal to the size of the stairs,
        // that means that we reached the top. So that concludes
        // one way on how to climb the stairs.
        if i == n {
            return 1;
        }

        // Here is the first magic point hehe
        // If we have the memo filled for that step then just return
        // it, so we don't have to calculate it again :) cool, right?
        if memo[i as usize] > 0 {
            return memo[i as usize];
        }

        // Here is the second magic point where the calculation happens.
        // Mainly what we are saying here is basically,
        // the number of options that we have to climb from the ith step 
        // to the top is the sum of options for the next step plus the
        // number of options for the current step plus 2.
        memo[i as usize] = Self::check_stairs(i + 1, n, memo) 
        + Self::check_stairs(i + 2, n, memo);

        // Here we return the content from our memoization structure
        memo[i as usize]
    }
}

#[test]
pub fn checks() {
    assert_eq!(2, Solution::climb_stairs(2));
    assert_eq!(3, Solution::climb_stairs(3));
    assert_eq!(4, Solution::climb_stairs(5));
